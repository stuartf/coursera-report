In order to use this you need a browser/extension that supports usercripts (chrome/safari: tampermonkey, firefox: greasemonkey).

Once you have the extension installed head over to https://openuserjs.org/scripts/stuartf/Coursera_Monthly_Totals and click the blue install button at the top right of the page.

After that when you go to https://www.coursera.org/teach-partner/gatech/monitor there will be an extra table at the bottom that summarizes the previous and current month's enrollments.
